# LCR CSV Downloader

The current LCR functionality to generate reports only creates PDFs, but doesn't allow to export as
a CSV file on
[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](https://lcr.churchofjesuschrist.org/report)
website. This chrome extension adds a button to download the custom report as a CSV file which
can be opened with google sheets or excel.

NOTE: This extension is not in any way affiliated or developed by the church.

# Installation

1. Scroll to the top of this page, click the green Code button and then "Download ZIP". After downloading, unzip it on your computer.

NOTE: This tool was only created for the LCR "Create a Report" function and will only display the
an additional button on that page. If the church updates the website and this no longer works, please
file an issue to fix the extension.

# Troubleshooting

1. If the button doesn't load the first time, just try refreshing the page.
